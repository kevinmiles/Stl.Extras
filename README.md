**Stl.Extras** is a collection of packages that are also a part of open-source
ServiceTitan Library, but aren't related to [Stl.Fusion](https://github.com/servicetitan/Stl.Fusion).

It includes:


| NuGet Package  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Stl.Plugins  | MEF-style plugin library that focuses on core capabilities needed to add plugins to your applicatin - namely, building an IoC container hosting them. |
| Stl.Plugins.Extensions  | Extensions allowing plugins to "tweak" `IHostBuilder` and other startup logic. |
| Stl.CommandLine  | A set of abstractions helping to construct typed wrappers for command line tools. |
| Stl.Hosting  | An experimental host similar to `IHost` that supports extensions via Stl.Plugins.  |
| Stl.Experimental  | Types that could be moved to `Stl` at some later point, or could be removed at all :) |

A better description will be published at some later point.
